// Exercise 002: Comments
//
// Comments are used to explain code to other programmers (and yourself!).
// C has two types of comments:
//   - Single line comments (like this one) start with //
//   - Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */
//
// Fix the broken comment below so the code compiles!
//
// HINT: Multi-line comments need a closing */

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    /* This is a multi-line comment
       that spans multiple lines
       but it's missing something...

    printf("Comments are useful!\n");
    return 0;
}
